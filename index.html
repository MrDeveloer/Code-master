     <p>Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for beginners and experts alike. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Its extensive standard library and vast ecosystem of third-party packages, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Django, enable its use in diverse fields like web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation. Python’s interpreted nature allows for rapid prototyping and cross-platform compatibility. Its clean syntax, dynamic typing, and strong community support have made it one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world.</p>

     <marquee>Web Development [HTML, CSS, JS]</marquee>
     <br><br>
     <p>Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online through a browser. It involves both front-end development, which focuses on the visual and interactive aspects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end development, which handles server-side logic, databases, and APIs using languages like Python, PHP, Ruby, or Node.js. Modern web development often relies on frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js for front-end efficiency, and Django, Flask, or Express.js for back-end functionality. With the rise of responsive design and progressive web apps (PWAs), developers ensure seamless user experiences across devices. The field continues to evolve with trends like serverless architecture, Jamstack, and AI integration, making web development a dynamic and essential skill in today's digital world.</p>

     <marquee> Linux Pro Professional Plus 2025</marquee>
     <br><br>
     <p>Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system based on Unix, known for its stability, security, and flexibility. Initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, Linux has since grown into a widely used platform, powering everything from personal computers and servers to embedded systems and supercomputers. Unlike proprietary operating systems, Linux is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), allowing users to freely modify and distribute its source code. Its modular design supports various distributions (distros) like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, catering to different user needs. Linux is highly favored by developers and system administrators due to its robust command-line interface (CLI), extensive customization options, and strong community support. Additionally, it serves as the backbone for many cloud computing environments and enterprise infrastructures, making it a cornerstone of modern computing.</p>
